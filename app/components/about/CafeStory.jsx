        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our café began with a simple dream — to serve the finest handcrafted
          coffee in a warm and welcoming space. Since 2015, we’ve grown into a
          community of coffee lovers who appreciate taste, comfort, and authenticity.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Inspired by global flavors and perfected by local passion,
          we believe every cup tells a story.
